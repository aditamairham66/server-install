To search for text in the `nano` text editor, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your file using `nano` or if it's already open, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - **Ctrl+W**: This keyboard shortcut allows you to initiate a search.
    - **Ctrl+\**: This keyboard shortcut allows you to search and replace text.

2. After pressing **Ctrl+W**, you will see the "Search: " prompt at the bottom of the `nano` window.

3. Type the text you want to search for and press Enter.

4. `nano` will take you to the first occurrence of the text. If there are multiple occurrences, you can press **Ctrl+W** again to find the next occurrence. Keep repeating this step until you find the text you're looking for.

5. If you want to search for the same text in reverse order (from the current position to the beginning of the file), you can press **Ctrl+Shift+W**.

6. To exit the search mode, you can press **Ctrl+C**.

Remember that these are the basic steps for searching in `nano`. `nano` also has other search options, such as case-sensitive searches and regular expressions. You can find more details in the `nano` manual by pressing **Ctrl+G** and then **Ctrl+T** to access the "Text" section of the manual.
